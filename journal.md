**September 8, 2025 The start of a new journey**

I created this journal to track my progress as I sharpen my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Express.js. My goal is to build better projects, become a stronger developer, and land a job where I can continue growing toward a senior role.

My drive comes from my wife and kids I want to give them a better life than the one I grew up with. My father, who worked hard as a janitor to support my education, taught me that a parent’s role is to help the next generation rise higher while never forgetting the struggles that shaped us.

I’m taking this leap of faith into software development not only to fulfill a lifelong dream, but to honor his legacy and provide for my family’s future.

**September 8, 2025 Basic Javascript Concepts**

Today I spent a couple hours reviewing and taking quizzes on basic JS concepts like, variables, strings. This was a good refresher to be able to remember basic rules that will come in handy when visiting more indepth and complex JS concepots. I also took the time to be able to search and save some jobs in huntr to be able to review them and see if those jobs that I saved align with my skill set.
